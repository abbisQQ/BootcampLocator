# BootcampLocator
In this app i worked with google maps and google play services to create an app that grabs and display the users location 
and idealy using a server notify the user if there are any Devslopes Boot Camp avaliable near him.
Cause we dont have a server to use we had to use some static data .
This project includes recycler view and custom adapter custom markers fragments zip codes and geocoding and in general some base foundation on
how to work with maps in android.
