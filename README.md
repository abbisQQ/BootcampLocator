# BootcampLocator
In this app i worked with google maps and google play services to create an app that grabs and display the users location 
and idealy using a server notify the user if there are any Devslopes Boot Camp avaliable near him.

Cause we dont have a server we had to use some static data .

This project includes recycler view and custom adapter 
custom markers 
fragments 
zip codes and geocoding
and in general some base foundation onhow to work with maps in android.
